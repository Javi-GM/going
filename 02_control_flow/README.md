# Chapter 2: Control Flow

This chapter covers the control flow statements in Go, which determine how your program executes code based on conditions and facilitate repetition.

## Topics Covered

1. **If/Else Statements**: Conditional code execution
2. **Switch Statements**: Multi-way branching
3. **For Loops**: Iteration and repetition
4. **Range**: Iterating over collections
5. **Break and Continue**: Controlling loop execution
6. **Defer**: Delaying execution until surrounding function returns
7. **Panic and Recover**: Error handling mechanisms

## Getting Started

Begin with the first section (01_if_else) and progress through each concept sequentially. Each subfolder contains:

- A README with explanations
- Test files that need fixing
- Example code to study

Remember to run the tests using `go test` to check your solutions!

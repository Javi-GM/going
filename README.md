# Learning Go by Practice

This repository is structured as a hands-on learning path for the Go programming language. Each folder represents a chapter covering a specific Go concept, organized in a logical progression from basics to more advanced topics.

## How This Repo Works

- Content is organized into numbered chapters (folders)
- Each chapter has numbered concept folders
- Every concept includes:
  - A README.md with explanations and examples
  - Failing tests that you need to fix (exercises)
  - Optional solution files for reference

## Learning Approach

1. Read the README.md in a concept folder to understand the topic
2. Look at the failing tests to understand what you need to implement
3. Write your Go code to make the tests pass
4. Run the tests to verify your solution
5. If needed, check the solution files for guidance

## Running Tests

To run tests for a specific exercise:

```bash
cd path/to/concept
go test
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v
```

## Prerequisites

- [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) on your system
- Basic programming knowledge
- Willingness to learn by doing!
